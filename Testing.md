How do i test this application
==========

Initial test cases are simple, they test the basic communication and look for no errors.
This part is manual, because I still look at the logs to see if every call succeeded.

### To test party messages, its a simple Manage party call
### To test login messages is something similar.
### To test company messages: we create a company for each party.

## Tests that can explode the model: 
### Manage product: Manage a product for each company
### Manage chart of accounts for each company
### Manage sales
### Manage shipments
### Manage production receipts
### Manage returns
