Notes: Because of the multiple declarations error for overloaded attribute names,
we have to create modules for each entity.
Also, the conventional support for an inheritance based generic class, such as
RequestType, Entity (where entity could be a data constructor) is not a recommended pattern, therefore we need to model entity as case expression when processing the entity.
We need a request log to manage log for the requests : time, ip etc.
